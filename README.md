# Critical Response: Securing NOVA‚Äôs Grid

**A Cybersecurity Crisis Simulation | Future of Security ‚Äì Virginia Tech, Spring 2025**

---

## Overview

This repository hosts all materials for the interactive simulation *Critical Response: Securing NOVA‚Äôs Grid*. The exercise challenges participants to respond to a catastrophic cyberattack on the electrical grid in Northern Virginia, simulating the high-pressure decisions made by public, private, and civil stakeholders during a national security crisis.

Participants take on roles such as government officials, infrastructure operators, media, and civil rights advocates. Over three structured phases, they must respond to injects (emergent developments), manage public sentiment, and propose actionable reforms‚Äîall while maintaining alignment with their stakeholder‚Äôs mission.

## Simulation Objectives

- Analyze and respond to cyber-physical infrastructure attacks
- Navigate ethical, legal, and political dilemmas in real time
- Coordinate multi-agency crisis communication and decision-making
- Evaluate public sentiment and maintain civic trust under pressure
- Reflect on system resilience, emergency powers, and reform strategies

## How to Use

1. **Explore the Simulation Website:**  
   Visit the GitHub Pages site to view the simulation structure and materials in a browsable format.

   > üåê [Simulation Website](https://avichals.github.io/future-of-security/)

2. **Assign Roles:**  
   Facilitators should use `/roles.md` and `/team/assignment.md` to designate stakeholder positions.

3. **Follow the Guide:**  
   Use `/guide.md` to run the simulation in three phases. Injects and PSI updates should be managed live.

4. **Debrief and Reflect:**  
   Use `/facilitator.md` and `/manual.md` to guide post-simulation reflection and scoring.
