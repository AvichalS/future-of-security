# 🎛️ Facilitator Instructions

> _"Guide the story. Shape the chaos. But never steal the participants' decisions."_  

This guide provides a tactical, real-time reference for facilitators managing the Critical Response: Securing NOVA’s Grid simulation.

---

## 🛠️ Facilitator Roles and Mindset

- **Stay Neutral:** Your role is to observe, inject challenges, and simulate external factors — not to guide participant decisions.
- **Manage Pacing:** Keep the simulation moving. Inject energy if discussions stall; slow things down if overwhelmed.
- **Amplify Realism:** Use injects, breaking news updates, or conflicting information to recreate authentic crisis tension.
- **Track Key Decisions:** Note major actions affecting infrastructure, public trust, diplomacy, civil liberties, or ethical outcomes.

## 🧩 Simulation Structure Recap

| Phase | Duration | Facilitator Focus |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Phase 1 – Initial Impact | 30 min | Drop initial injects, monitor chaos handling |
| Phase 2 – Coordinated Response | 45 min | Introduce ethical/diplomatic dilemmas, adjust PSI |
| Phase 3 – Post-Crisis Stabilization | 30 min | Push for reforms, public hearings, final consequences |
| Debrief | 15 min | Lead participant reflection |

## 🎭 Inject Deployment Guidelines

- **Phase 1 (10–15 mins in):**  
  Introduce _Viral Disinformation_, _Critical Generator Failure_, or _Vendor Negligence Leak_.
  
- **Phase 2 (at major decision points):**  
  Introduce _Civil Unrest_, _Malware Mutation_, or _Whistleblower Leak_.

- **Inject Tips:**
  - Be vague initially — real-world info is incomplete.
  - Force participants to adapt, prioritize, and act without full certainty.

## 📊 Tracking Public Sentiment Index (PSI)

Use the following events to adjust PSI scores:

| Event Type | PSI Effect |
|:---|:---|
| Transparent public updates | +10% |
| Restoration of critical facilities | +15% |
| Misinformation left unchecked | -20% |
| Mass surveillance without public justification | -25% |
| Blame shifting without evidence | -15% |

*Start at 75% trust at simulation launch.*

## 🚨 Handling Crisis Escalation

- **If players freeze:** Introduce time-limited injects ("Hospital backup power fails in 20 minutes. Decide now.").
- **If players agree too easily:**  
  Create role conflict ("Civil Liberties Group sues Ministry of Internal Security.").
- **If simulation derails:**  
  Gently reframe by introducing critical consequences ("A second malware strain spreads.").

---

## 🧠 Debriefing After Simulation

Structure the final 15 minutes into these phases:

1. **Quick Recap:** What decisions shaped the crisis most?
2. **Learning Points:**  
   - How did role perspectives affect choices?
   - What real-world lessons apply?
3. **Ethical Reflection:**  
   - How did participants balance security vs. civil liberties?
   - What could have been handled differently?
4. **Score Reflection:**  
   - Final PSI score and its meaning.
   - Overall system resilience score.

> **Final Note:** Facilitators are the hidden architects. Stay invisible, stay adaptive, and build pressure organically. Participants should feel ownership of both success and failure.
