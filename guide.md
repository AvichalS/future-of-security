# 🧪 Simulation Walkthrough

> _"Crisis demands rapid action, adaptive leadership, and cross-sector coordination under uncertainty."_

This guide provides a detailed step-by-step flow for executing the Critical Response: Securing NOVA’s Grid simulation. It outlines phase objectives, participant expectations, facilitator responsibilities, and timing structures.

---

## 🏁 Pre-Simulation Preparation

| Task | Owner | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Assign stakeholder roles | Facilitators | Ensure diversity across sectors |
| Distribute briefing materials | Facilitators | Scenario background, stakeholder objectives |
| Review simulation tools | Facilitators & Participants | Injects, PSI Tracker, public statement templates |

- Ensure all tech platforms (chat, video, or breakout rooms if virtual) are functioning.
- Provide PSI (Public Sentiment Index) baseline: 75% public trust at simulation start.

## 🗓️ Phase Timeline

| Phase | Focus | Duration |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Phase 1 – Initial Impact** | Emergency response, misinformation control | 30 minutes |
| **Phase 2 – Coordinated Response** | Restoration, diplomacy, surveillance dilemmas | 45 minutes |
| **Phase 3 – Post-Crisis Stabilization** | Attribution, public accountability, reform debates | 30 minutes |
| **Debrief** | Lessons learned, best practices reflection | 15 minutes |

*Facilitators may extend phases by 5–10 minutes depending on group dynamics.*

---

## ⚡ Phase 1: Initial Impact

**Focus:**
- Immediate infrastructure damage reports.
- Public confusion, panic, and misattribution.
- Emergency decision-making under extreme uncertainty.

**Participant Actions:**
- Prioritize critical service restoration (hospitals, airports, datacenters).
- Craft initial public communications to maintain trust and order.
- Coordinate internally to share credible intel on the breach.

**Facilitator Actions:**
- Drop **first inject** (e.g., Viral Disinformation, Generator Failure) within first 10 minutes.
- Track participant decisions that could affect Public Sentiment Index (PSI).

---

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Coordinated Response

**Focus:**
- Multi-sector restoration operations.
- Ethical and political challenges emerge.
- Attribution rumors and international tensions rise.

**Participant Actions:**
- Debate emergency surveillance expansions.
- Balance diplomacy with national security posture.
- Manage evolving public sentiment through media engagements.

**Facilitator Actions:**
- Introduce **second injects** (e.g., Civil Unrest, Malware Mutation).
- Update PSI based on visible participant actions (transparency, restoration success, rumor control).

---

## 🧹 Phase 3: Post-Crisis Stabilization

**Focus:**
- Investigation findings announced.
- Policy recommendations and public trust rebuilding efforts.
- Address civil liberties criticisms and propose resilience reforms.

**Participant Actions:**
- Draft new cybersecurity legislation or executive orders.
- Propose cross-sector resilience frameworks.
- Reassess emergency powers and restore civil norms.

**Facilitator Actions:**
- Deliver final inject (e.g., Attribution Leak, Whistleblower Story).
- Drive participants toward consensus or highlight divisions.

---

## 🔥 Real-Time Inject Integration

- **Injects** simulate dynamic crisis shifts (unexpected leaks, protest outbreaks, second malware wave).
- Facilitators drop injects **mid-phase** without prior warning.
- Participants must treat injects as “live information” requiring real-time decision-making.
- Injects should deliberately introduce ethical, legal, and operational dilemmas.

## 📊 Public Sentiment Index (PSI) Tracker

Track public trust across simulation:

| PSI Score | Public Mood |
|:---|:---|
| 90–100% | Calm, cooperative |
| 70–89% | Cautious but trusting |
| 50–69% | Skeptical, rumors spreading |
| 30–49% | Panicked, unrest emerging |
| <30% | Full-blown public crisis |

Adjust PSI after:
- Transparency boosts
- Misinformation failures
- Unethical surveillance expansions
- Successful partial restorations

---

## 🧠 Facilitator Best Practices

- **Control Pace:** Watch for slowdowns. Drop injects if participants are stuck or idle.
- **Balance Chaos:** Keep injects challenging but not overwhelming.
- **Stay Neutral:** Do not “correct” bad decisions unless simulation is derailing.
- **Document Decisions:** Track major participant actions for debrief quality.

---

## 🎯 Simulation End Conditions

The simulation concludes when:
- Phase 3 post-crisis reforms are proposed OR
- Public Sentiment Index falls below 30% (complete system breakdown)

Participants then enter structured debrief:

- Discuss what worked
- Analyze decision-making patterns
- Reflect on ethical tensions and cross-sector coordination challenges

**Next Step:**  
Move to your assigned [Stakeholder Role](roles) and begin preparations for Phase 1: Initial Impact.
