# ⚡ Critical Response: Securing NOVA’s Grid

> _A cybersecurity simulation where participants respond to a grid-wide blackout caused by a coordinated cyberattack on critical infrastructure in Northern Virginia._

---

## 🧭 Overview

This simulation mirrors real-world incidents like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware breach and Ukraine's power grid hacks. Participants assume key stakeholder roles—cybersecurity agencies, utility executives, policy leaders, and more—and must respond under pressure to:

- Restore critical infrastructure
- Manage civil unrest and misinformation
- Make ethical decisions on surveillance and attribution
- Build long-term resilience post-crisis

---

## 🗓️ Simulation Timeline

- **Pre-Attack:** Cyber intelligence detects probing activity
- **Day Zero (May 5, 2025):** Power grid failure impacts Northern Virginia
- **Days 1–5:** Emergency response, stakeholder decisions, media chaos
- **Post-Crisis:** Investigations, public policy debates, system reform
