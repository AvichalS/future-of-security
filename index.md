# ⚡ Critical Response: Securing NOVA’s Grid

> _A real-world cybersecurity simulation built to test your leadership, response agility, and ethical judgment during a catastrophic power grid attack in Northern Virginia._

---

### 🧭 What Is This Simulation About?

This simulation immerses participants in a fast-evolving cyber-physical emergency where the electrical grid across Northern Virginia has been crippled by a ransomware-style attack. Hospitals go dark. Disinformation spreads online. International tensions escalate.

Participants take on roles of national and private-sector stakeholders to:

- Restore infrastructure and public order
- Address civil liberties and surveillance debates
- Coordinate a multi-agency response
- Rebuild trust and resilience post-crisis
