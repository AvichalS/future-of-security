# ⚡ Critical Response: Securing NOVA’s Grid

**Imagine waking up in Northern Virginia. No power. Traffic lights off. Hospitals running on backup. Misinformation flooding social media.**  
This simulation immerses you in a high-stakes, real-world inspired cybersecurity crisis, where critical infrastructure is under attack.

> _“This isn’t just a simulation—it’s your rehearsal for reality.”_

## 🧭 Simulation Overview

This cyber crisis scenario centers around a synchronized attack on the electrical grid in Northern Virginia. Inspired by real incidents like the Colonial Pipeline ransomware breach and Ukraine’s grid hacks, the simulation challenges you to:

- Coordinate responses across public and private sectors
- Navigate misinformation and ethical dilemmas
- Restore public trust and essential infrastructure
- Propose long-term cybersecurity reforms
