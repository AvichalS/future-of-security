# üìç Simulation Event Map ‚Äì Critical Response: Securing NOVA‚Äôs Grid

> _"Key sites across Northern Virginia are under threat. Your mission: protect critical infrastructure, coordinate crisis response, and restore public trust."_

This map highlights essential locations impacted during the simulated cyberattack against Northern Virginia‚Äôs power grid and digital infrastructure.

Each marker represents a site that participants may need to prioritize, defend, or restore during different phases of the simulation.

## üó∫Ô∏è Key Objectives Related to the Map

- **Infrastructure Defense:** Identify and prioritize critical service facilities (e.g., hospitals, energy control centers).
- **Crisis Communication:** Manage public trust through hospitals, government centers, and media coordination points.
- **Cyber Resilience:** Protect cloud and data center operations to maintain national and regional digital continuity.
- **International Relations:** Handle diplomatic fallout involving federal cybersecurity hubs and foreign data dependencies.

## üß≠ How to Use the Map During Simulation

- **Early Phases (Impact):** Focus on physical sites needing immediate power restoration (e.g., hospitals, grid control centers).
- **Mid Phases (Response):** Monitor sites vulnerable to misinformation, secondary attacks, or protests (e.g., government facilities).
- **Late Phases (Stabilization):** Debate and propose resilience plans that protect or redesign these key hubs.

Participants should continuously reference the map when crafting restoration plans, media strategies, and diplomatic messaging.

## üß† Facilitator Tip

Introduce new injects or dynamic challenges linked to these locations (e.g., a secondary attack on the AWS data center, civil unrest outside the Department of Energy).
