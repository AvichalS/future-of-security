# 📝 Public Communication Template

> _"What you say during crisis shapes what the public believes — and how they act."_  
> Use this template to draft public statements, press releases, or inter-agency announcements during the simulation. Messaging is a powerful tool in stabilizing panic, reinforcing trust, and steering the narrative.

---

## 🗣️ Template Format

**From:** `[Your Role/Organization]`  
**To:** `[Public / Government / Sector Partners / All]`  
**Timestamp:** `[Simulation Clock Time]`

---

### 🔹 Statement:

> “[Insert 2–4 sentence official message.]  
> Clarify status of the grid, public safety, recovery efforts, and call to action (if any). Avoid unverified blame. Maintain credibility.”

---

### 🔹 Example:

> “The National Cybersecurity Agency, in coordination with the Department of Energy, is investigating the coordinated grid failure in Northern Virginia.  
> Hospitals are operating on backup systems, and emergency crews are active across key sectors.  
> We ask the public to remain calm and refer only to official channels for updates.”

## 📐 Strategic Messaging Guidelines

| Dimension | Best Practice |
|:---|:---|
| **Clarity** | Use concrete, short sentences. No jargon. |
| **Tone** | Calm, assertive, never defensive. |
| **Transparency** | Disclose facts, not speculation. Admit uncertainty when needed. |
| **Trust-building** | Use “we” and “together” language. Align with public good. |
| **Timeliness** | Early messaging always wins over silence. Don’t wait for perfect info. |

## ❌ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Assigning blame without attribution
- Minimizing impact ("It's under control") when it’s clearly not
- Conflicting info from different agencies (coordinate statements!)
- Overusing passive voice (own your response)

---

## ✅ Use Cases in Simulation

- First public message post-blackout (Phase 1)
- Clarifying emergency measures (Phase 2)
- Addressing surveillance, rights concerns (Phase 2/3)
- Concluding statement post-stabilization (Phase 3)

> 💡 **Tip:** Run communications by Civil Liberties and Media roles before going public, if time permits. Friction creates realism.
