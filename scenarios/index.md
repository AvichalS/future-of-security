# 🧠 Scenario Background

> _"What happens when the power goes out—not just for minutes, but for days? And not by accident, but by cyberattack?"_

This simulation is set in **Northern Virginia**, a critical region for U.S. infrastructure and data networks. A coordinated cyber-physical attack targets the power grid, causing widespread blackouts, operational chaos, and rising public fear.

---

## 🔥 Crisis Overview

On **May 5, 2025**, multiple substations in NOVA are hit by a ransomware-style grid breach. Hospitals are forced onto generators. Traffic systems fail. Social media explodes with misinformation and blame. With attribution unclear, the federal response becomes a race against cascading collapse.

The simulation places participants in a multi-agency task force to:
- Identify the cause of the attack
- Manage public communication and civil unrest
- Coordinate inter-sector responses
- Develop a post-crisis policy strategy

---

## 🌍 Real-World Inspiration

- **Colonial Pipeline (2021):** Fuel shortages after a ransomware attack on energy infrastructure
- **Ukraine Grid Hacks (2015–16):** State-sponsored cyberattacks that disabled electricity for over 230,000 people
- **NOVA’s Criticality:** Over 70% of global internet traffic routes through this region daily

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Participants will:
- Analyze cyber vulnerabilities in public utilities
- Weigh legal, political, and ethical responses
- Develop coordinated emergency strategies
- Navigate a disinformation-driven public narrative

## 📦 Simulation Structure

This scenario spans **3 simulation rounds**:
1. **Impact:** Initial attack, blackout, confusion
2. **Response:** Emergency coordination, messaging, triage
3. **Stabilization:** Attribution, hearings, reforms

Each phase includes “injects” (new developments) delivered in real time by facilitators.
