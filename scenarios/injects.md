# 🎭 Scenario Injects

> _"Expect the unexpected. These injects simulate the chaos, misinformation, and difficult decisions leaders must navigate during a cybersecurity crisis."_

Injects are dynamic, real-time scenario developments introduced by the facilitator during the simulation rounds. They increase complexity, add uncertainty, and push participants to adapt strategies quickly.

## 🔥 Sample Injects for Phase 1 – Initial Impact

- **⚡ Viral Disinformation:** A trending social media post falsely claims a neighboring country orchestrated the attack.
- **🏥 Critical Generator Failure:** A hospital's backup generator is about to fail within two hours.
- **🔓 Vendor Negligence Leak:** Internal emails leak revealing a utility vendor ignored known vulnerabilities.
- **📉 Public Trust Erosion:** A sudden, fake news story alleges the government had prior warning but failed to act.

## 🛠️ Sample Injects for Phase 2 – Coordinated Response

- **🌐 International Fallout:** Preliminary attribution (unverified) points to a close U.S. ally, causing diplomatic tension.
- **🦠 Malware Mutation:** A new malware variant disables some backup systems that were restored.
- **📣 Civil Unrest:** Public protests erupt over increased surveillance measures being proposed as part of the emergency response.
- **🧑‍💻 Insider Threat Warning:** Intelligence reports suggest a mole within a key agency aiding misinformation campaigns.

## 🧠 Facilitator Best Practices

- Introduce 1–2 injects per phase based on participant progress and timing.
- Ensure injects create trade-offs: legal vs. urgent action, transparency vs. panic control.
- Allow participants to request clarifications, but be deliberately vague to simulate real ambiguity.

**Next Phase:** After handling injects, participants will stabilize the situation, investigate attribution, and debate long-term reforms.
