# ⚠️ Phase 1 – Initial Impact

> _"The lights go out. The clock starts ticking."_

On the morning of **May 5, 2025**, a series of coordinated cyber intrusions bring down major electrical substations across Northern Virginia. The grid collapses. Emergency lines are jammed. Traffic lights fail. Hospitals switch to backup generators. Misinformation floods social media blaming foreign actors, insider threats, and even solar flares.

## 🎯 Participant Objectives in This Phase

- Analyze the initial breach reports from NCA and local utilities.
- Prioritize emergency power restoration for hospitals, airports, and data centers.
- Begin public messaging via trusted channels (e.g., local radio).
- Decide whether to request emergency powers or military involvement.

## ⚡ Key Questions

- Which facilities should be prioritized for power recovery?
- How do you manage the risk of panic vs. transparency in your communication?
- What early attribution signals do you trust, if any?

## 🧠 Facilitator Notes

Inject optional surprises:
- A viral tweet blames a neighboring country.
- An unauthorized leak shows a known vulnerability was ignored last year.
- A hospital system files an SOS — their generator has 2 hours of fuel left.
