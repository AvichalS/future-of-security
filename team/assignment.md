# ðŸ§© Role Assignment â€“ Coalition Participation Strategy

> _"In this simulation, each participant leads a coalition of interconnected stakeholders, simulating complexity even with a lean team."_  
> This structure allows a 3-member team to realistically simulate 9 critical perspectives during the cyber crisis.

## ðŸ§  How Coalitions Work

Each participant plays:
- **One Primary Role**: Full decision-making power
- **Two Secondary Roles**: Advisory voice; must be represented in decisions
- **Internal Tradeoffs**: Simulate conflict within your coalition (e.g., ethics vs. enforcement)

Participants must consider **conflicting priorities** across the roles they represent, and negotiate externally with other coalitions.

## ðŸ‘¥ Coalition Assignment Table

| Participant        | Primary Role                             | Secondary Roles (Influence)                                      | Coalition Theme         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|

## ðŸ”— Coalition Responsibilities

| Coalition | Primary Focus | Example Decisions |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------|
| Internal Security & Ethics | Law enforcement, emergency powers, civil rights | Approving surveillance tools, managing domestic unrest |
| Cyber-Infrastructure Command | Digital breach response, power restoration, technical triage | Prioritizing hospitals vs. data centers, releasing incident reports |
| Narrative & Diplomacy | International posture, press releases, misinformation | Handling attribution, issuing public statements, diplomacy with allies |

---

## ðŸ“Œ Simulation Guidelines

- All participants must **speak in-role** during each phase.
- Internal tensions should be **voiced and resolved publicly** (simulate agency debates).
- External negotiations occur across coalitions.
- Facilitators may inject prompts targeting **secondary roles** to generate pressure.

---

## âœ… Simulation Checklist

- [x] All stakeholder roles are covered by coalition design  
- [x] Participant teams briefed on all assigned roles  
- [x] Each coalition understands both **internal** and **external** responsibilities  
- [ ] Secondary role biases uploaded in Resources *(optional)*
