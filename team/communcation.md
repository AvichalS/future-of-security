## 🔗 Communication Guidelines

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Stay in-role** | Communicate from your assigned stakeholder’s voice and values. |
| **2. Timestamp** | Begin your post with the current simulation clock time (e.g., `🕒 10:22 AM – Phase 1`). |
| **3. Be concise** | Keep messages under 4–5 lines when possible. |
| **4. No out-of-character (OOC)** | All messages must reflect your simulation role. Use private chat for behind-the-scenes strategy. |
| **5. Monitor this space** | Facilitators may post injects, updates, or signal key turning points here. Stay alert. |
